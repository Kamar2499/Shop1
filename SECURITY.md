## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues very seriously. If you discover a security issue in our project, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing our security team at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with the subject line "[SECURITY] Vulnerability in [project name]".

In your email, please include:

Our security team will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and will keep you updated on the progress towards fixing the issue.

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow the principle of responsible disclosure. This means:

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. We will confirm the existence of the vulnerability
3. We will work on a fix in a private repository
4. We will release a fix as soon as possible
5. We will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to address the vulnerability before any public disclosure
- Avoid violating privacy, destroying data, or disrupting our service
- Keep vulnerability details confidential until we've had time to address them
- Not exploit the vulnerability for your own gain

### Bug Bounty

At this time, we do not offer a paid bug bounty program. However, we are happy to publicly acknowledge your contribution if you would like.

## Security Updates and Alerts

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2). We recommend always running the latest patch version of the software.

For critical security issues, we will:

1. Release a security advisory
2. Notify all users through our standard communication channels
3. Provide clear upgrade instructions
